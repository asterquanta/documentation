# Global Optimization

The **Global Optimization** feature allows you to optimize multiple parameters of a circuit across a wide range of values to find the best configuration or solution. This is achieved by adjusting various factors such as resistance, capacitance, or other design parameters in an automated way. The goal is to improve the overall performance of the circuit, such as maximizing efficiency, minimizing power consumption, or achieving desired signal integrity.

### Features:
- **Parameter Tuning:** Adjust design parameters like resistance, capacitance, and others to meet specific performance goals.
- **Simultaneous Adjustments:** Optimize the interaction between different parts of the circuit to work efficiently as a whole.
- **AI Optimization:** Select an AI agent to carry out optimizations using algorithms like genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization. The AI will explore different combinations of parameters and iteratively refine them to reach an optimal solution.

### Options Available:
- **AI Agent Selection:** Choose an AI agent to perform the optimization.
- **View Log File:** Access logs for tracking optimization progress.
- **Download Netlist:** Download the optimized netlist for further analysis.
- **Import from File / Export to File:** Import and export parameter files for optimized configurations.
- **Scalar Measurements & Symbols:** Take scalar measurements from the simulation and use symbols to create expressions for the optimization process.
