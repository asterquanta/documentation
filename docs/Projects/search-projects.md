# Search Projects

The **Search Projects** feature allows you to efficiently explore and manage a wide variety of circuit design projects. You can use intuitive tools to filter, search, and sort your projects to find the ones that best fit your needs.

## Filter by Project Type
A **dropdown menu** at the top-left lets you filter projects based on their category:

- **Analog**
- **Digital**
- **Mixed**
- **System**
- **Equipment**

> **Note**: At present, only **Analog** projects are supported. Support for other project types will be introduced in future versions.

## Search by Title
Next to the filter, a **search bar** enables quick lookup of projects by title. Enter a keyword or project name in the search bar and click the **Search** button to find matching projects instantly.

## Sort Options
To the right of the search bar, a **dropdown menu** provides sorting options:

- **Sort by Name**
- **Sort by Tags**

These sorting options allow you to organize and display projects based on your preferred view, whether by project name or relevant tags.
