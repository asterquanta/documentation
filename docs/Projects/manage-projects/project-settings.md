- **Project Name**: Modify the name of your project.
- **Project Description**: Update the project description to reflect any changes or additional information.
- **Project Tags**: Add or remove tags associated with the project to improve searchability.

## Privacy Settings
This section allows you to control the visibility of your project:

- **Public**: Makes the project visible to all users.
- **Private**: Restricts access to the project, making it only visible to authorized users or yourself.

Each role has different levels of access, so be sure to assign roles based on the collaborator's involvement.

- **Version Control**: Enable or disable version control to track changes made to the project over time.
- **Project Integration**: Set up integrations with external tools or platforms if applicable (e.g., for simulation, hardware testing, etc.).

> **Warning:** Changes to advanced settings can have significant effects on how the project functions. Please proceed with caution.
