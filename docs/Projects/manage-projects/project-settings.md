# Project Settings

The **Project Settings** page allows you to manage various configurations and preferences related to your project. From here, you can control important settings that affect how the project is handled and displayed.

## General Settings
In the **General Settings** section, you can update the basic information of the project, such as:

- **Project Name**: Modify the name of your project.
- **Project Description**: Update the project description to reflect any changes or additional information.
- **Project Tags**: Add or remove tags associated with the project to improve searchability.

## Collaborators & Permissions
If your project is collaborative, you can manage permissions for other users:

- **Add Collaborators**: Invite users to collaborate on the project by entering their username or email.
- **Assign Roles**: Set different roles for collaborators, such as **Editor**, **Viewer**, or **Admin**.
  
Each role has different levels of access, so be sure to assign roles based on the collaborator's involvement.

## Save Changes
Once you've made the desired changes, click the **Save Settings** button to apply the changes to your project.

## Reset to Defaults
If you want to undo all changes made and return to the original settings, you can click the **Reset to Defaults** button.
