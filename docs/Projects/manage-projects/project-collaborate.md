# Project Collaboration

The **Project Collaboration** page allows you to manage collaborators on your project. This feature enables team members to work together, share resources, and track the progress of the project. You can add or remove collaborators, assign roles, and communicate with them effectively.

## Adding Collaborators
To add collaborators to your project, follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Add Collaborator** button.
2. Enter the email address or username of the person you want to invite to collaborate.
3. Choose a role for the collaborator:
   - **Viewer**: Can view project details but cannot make changes.
   - **Editor**: Can edit project details, add files, and make modifications.
   - **Admin**: Has full access to all project settings, including the ability to add or remove collaborators.

After entering the required information, click **Send Invitation**. The collaborator will receive an invitation to join the project.

> **Note:** Collaborators must accept the invitation before they are granted access to the project.

## Removing Collaborators
To remove a collaborator from the project:

1. Go to the list of collaborators on the **Project Collaboration** page.
2. Find the collaborator you wish to remove.
3. Click the **Remove** button next to their name.

Once removed, the collaborator will no longer have access to the project, and their permissions will be revoked immediately.

## Project Permissions
Each collaborator on the project will have specific permissions based on their assigned role. Permissions can be modified at any time by an Admin:

- **View**: View project details.
- **Edit**: Modify project files and change project settings.
- **Admin**: Manage all aspects of the project, including collaboration settings.

## Collaboration Guidelines
To ensure smooth collaboration, it's recommended to:

- Maintain clear and open communication with your collaborators.
- Assign specific tasks or roles to each collaborator.
