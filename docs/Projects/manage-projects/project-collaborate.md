# Project Collaboration

The **Project Collaboration** page allows you to manage collaborators on your project. This feature enables team members to work together, share resources, and track the progress of the project. You can add or remove collaborators, assign roles, and communicate with them effectively.

## Adding Collaborators
To add collaborators to your project, follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Add Collaborator** button.
2. Enter the email address or username of the person you want to invite to collaborate.
3. Choose a role for the collaborator:
   - **Viewer**: Can view project details but cannot make changes.
   - **Editor**: Can edit project details, add files, and make modifications.
   - **Admin**: Has full access to all project settings, including the ability to add or remove collaborators.

After entering the required information, click **Send Invitation**. The collaborator will receive an invitation to join the project.

> **Note:** Collaborators must accept the invitation before they are granted access to the project.

## Removing Collaborators
To remove a collaborator from the project:

1. Go to the list of collaborators on the **Project Collaboration** page.
2. Find the collaborator you wish to remove.
3. Click the **Remove** button next to their name.

Once removed, the collaborator will no longer have access to the project, and their permissions will be revoked immediately.

## Project Permissions
Each collaborator on the project will have specific permissions based on their assigned role. Permissions can be modified at any time by an Admin:

- **View**: View project details, including documentation and results.
- **Edit**: Modify project files, update documentation, and change project settings.
- **Admin**: Manage all aspects of the project, including collaboration settings and project visibility.

## Notifications for Collaborators
Collaborators can receive notifications about project updates, changes, and important events. You can enable or disable notifications for specific collaborators in the **Project Settings** page.

> **Note:** Ensure that all collaborators are notified about critical changes, such as project publishing or deletions.

## Collaborator Activity
You can track the activity of collaborators on the project. The activity log shows actions taken by each collaborator, such as:

- Changes made to project files or documentation.
- New collaborators added.
- Permissions changes.

This helps maintain transparency and ensures everyone is on the same page.

## Collaboration Guidelines
To ensure smooth collaboration, it's recommended to:

- Maintain clear and open communication with your collaborators.
- Assign specific tasks or roles to each collaborator.
- Regularly update the project documentation to reflect changes made by collaborators.

> **Note:** If any issues arise between collaborators, you can always remove a collaborator or modify their permissions to resolve conflicts.
