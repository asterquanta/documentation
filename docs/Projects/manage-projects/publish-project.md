# Publish Project

The **Publish Project** page allows you to make your project publicly available after completing all necessary steps, such as documentation, testing, and review. By publishing your project, you make it accessible to others for viewing, collaboration, or inspiration.

## Preparing to Publish

- **Completed Project**: All components of the project should be finalized, including design, simulation, documentation, and testing.

## Publishing Options
The **Publish Project** page provides the following options:

- **Add a Description**: Write a brief description of your project to give others an overview of what it is about. Include important details such as its purpose, features, and any specific instructions for use.
  
- **Select a Category**: Choose the category that best fits your project. Categories include:
  - Analog
  - Digital
  - Mixed
  - System
  - Equipment

- **Tags**: Add relevant tags to help users search for your project. Tags should be keywords that describe the project's functionality or topic (e.g., "Signal Processing," "IoT," "Simulation").

## Review and Confirm
Once you've filled out all the necessary information, take a moment to review everything:

- **Preview**: Review the project details, description, and settings to ensure accuracy.
- **Collaborators**: Ensure all collaborators are added, and their roles are properly assigned.
