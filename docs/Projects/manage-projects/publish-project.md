# Publish Project

The **Publish Project** page allows you to make your project publicly available after completing all necessary steps, such as documentation, testing, and review. By publishing your project, you make it accessible to others for viewing, collaboration, or inspiration.

## Preparing to Publish
Before publishing, ensure that your project meets the following requirements:

- **Completed Project**: All components of the project should be finalized, including design, simulation, documentation, and testing.
- **Approval Status**: Your project must be approved by the necessary authorities or collaborators. If the project is awaiting authorization, ensure that the approval process is completed.

## Publishing Options
The **Publish Project** page provides the following options:

- **Visibility**: Choose whether the project will be **public** or **restricted**. A public project is visible to all users, while a restricted project is only accessible to specific users or collaborators.
  
- **Add a Description**: Write a brief description of your project to give others an overview of what it is about. Include important details such as its purpose, features, and any specific instructions for use.
  
- **Select a Category**: Choose the category that best fits your project. Categories include:
  - Analog
  - Digital
  - Mixed
  - System
  - Equipment

- **Tags**: Add relevant tags to help users search for your project. Tags should be keywords that describe the project's functionality or topic (e.g., "Signal Processing," "IoT," "Simulation").

## Review and Confirm
Once you've filled out all the necessary information, take a moment to review everything:

- **Preview**: Review the project details, description, and settings to ensure accuracy.
- **Collaborators**: Ensure all collaborators are added, and their roles are properly assigned.

> **Note:** Once you publish the project, it may take a few moments for it to be indexed and visible to others, depending on the system's processing time.

## Publish the Project
Click the **Publish Project** button to officially make your project live. Upon successful publishing, your project will be available to others in the **Public Projects** section, and you will receive a confirmation notification.

> **Warning:** Once the project is published, changes may still be made, but some settings (like visibility) might be restricted. Be sure you're ready to share your work with others.

## Unpublish Project
If you decide to remove the project from the public view, you can unpublish it at any time. Simply go to the **Project Settings** page and click **Unpublish Project**. This will make the project private again and hidden from others.

> **Note:** Unpublishing does not delete the project. It simply restricts access to it.
