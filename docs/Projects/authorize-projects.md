# Authorize Projects

The [**Authorize Projects**](https://photon.asterquanta.com/home/projects) page displays the projects that you have completed and submitted, which are awaiting authorization. These projects have been submitted for review, and once approved, they will be moved to the **Public Projects** section.

## Submitted Projects Awaiting Authorization
Here, you will see a list of all the projects you have completed and submitted for review. Each project will show:

- **Project Title**: The title you assigned to the project.
- **Submission Date**: The date when the project was submitted for review.
- **Status**: A label indicating that the project is "Pending Authorization."

Once the project is authorized, it will automatically be moved to the **Public Projects** section, where others can view, clone, and collaborate on it.

## Requesting Authorization
If you believe there is an issue or need to make adjustments, you can request feedback or submit updates to the project for review. Please ensure that the project adheres to the guidelines and requirements before submitting for authorization.

> **Note**: Only projects that meet the authorization criteria will be approved for public release.
