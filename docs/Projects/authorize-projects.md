# Authorize Projects

The [**Authorize Projects**](https://photon.asterquanta.com/home/projects) page displays the projects that you have published and are ready to authorize for public availability. After publishing a project, you must authorize it here to make it fully accessible to others.

## How to Publish and Authorize Your Project

### Step 1: Publish Your Project
To make your project available for authorization:

1. Open the project you want to publish
2. Click on **Publish Project** within the project interface
3. Enter a name for your project
4. Click **Proceed**

After completing these steps, you will see a notification: **"Project published! Please click 'authorize' in authorize projects to make it fully public."**

### Step 2: Authorize Your Project
Once you've published your project, you need to authorize it:

1. Navigate to the **Authorize Projects** section
2. Find your published project in the list
3. Click **Authorize** next to the project
4. Click **Proceed** to confirm

Your project will then be moved to the **Public Projects** section, where others can view, clone, and collaborate on it.

## Published Projects Awaiting Authorization
This section displays all projects you have published but not yet authorized. Each project will show:

- **Project Title**: The name you assigned during publication
- **Publication Date**: The date when the project was published
- **Status**: A label indicating "Awaiting Authorization"

> **Note**: Projects must be both published and authorized by you to become publicly available.
