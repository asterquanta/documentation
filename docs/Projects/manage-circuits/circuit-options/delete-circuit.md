The **Delete Circuit** option allows you to remove a circuit from your project. Once deleted, the action cannot be undone, so make sure you really want to delete the circuit before confirming.

## Confirmation Message

When you click on **Delete Circuit**, the following confirmation message will appear:

> **"Are you sure?**  
> Please confirm if you want to delete this circuit."

You will be prompted to confirm your decision before the circuit is permanently deleted. Be sure to review the circuit details carefully before confirming the deletion.
