# Manage Dependencies

The **Manage Dependencies** section allows you to manage and add various dependencies required for your circuits. These dependencies can be sourced from different categories such as **Models**, **Sub-Circuits**, **Libraries**, and **Symbols**.

## Add Dependencies

You can easily add dependencies to your circuit by selecting the relevant category and uploading the required files. Here are the available categories:

- **Models**: Upload model files necessary for the simulation of your circuit components.
- **Sub-Circuits**: Add sub-circuit files that are essential for your circuit's functionality.
- **Libraries**: Include libraries containing predefined components and functions to enhance your circuit design.
- **Symbols**: Attach symbol files to represent various components in your circuit schematics.

Each dependency type is crucial for the proper functioning of your circuit and its simulation. Be sure to upload the necessary files based on your circuit's requirements.

## Manage Your Dependencies

Once you add a dependency, it will be listed in the **Manage Dependencies** section. You can view, remove, or update dependencies as needed.

This feature ensures that all necessary files and components are linked to your circuit design for seamless simulation and optimization.
