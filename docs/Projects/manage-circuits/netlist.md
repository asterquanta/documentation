# Netlist

A **Netlist** is a machine-readable representation of an electronic circuit. It contains information about the components used in the circuit, their connections, parameters, and instructions for simulation.

When you upload a circuit, the system either generates a Netlist based on the schematic or allows you to provide one. This file is crucial for accurate simulation and analysis of the circuit.

The Netlist includes:

- Definitions for components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and voltage sources
- Node connections for each component
- Model references for component behavior
- Parameter definitions and library files
- Simulation commands and measurement instructions

> The Netlist is the foundation for simulating circuit behavior and obtaining analytical results. Make sure it reflects the intended design accurately before proceeding with simulation.
