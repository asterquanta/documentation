# Simulation Setup

The **Simulation Setup** section displays important metadata and tools related to the execution of your circuit simulation. It allows you to track timing, review logs, and access the generated netlist.

---

## Fields Included

- **Start Time**: Indicates the exact timestamp when the simulation began.
- **Completion Time**: Displays the timestamp when the simulation completed.
- **Elapsed Time**: Shows the total time taken to complete the simulation.

---

## Tools

- **Logs**: Access detailed logs related to the simulation process. These logs help diagnose errors or performance issues.
- **Netlist**: View the updated netlist generated after the simulation, which includes the optimized design parameters. This netlist reflects the final circuit configuration processed by the simulation engine.
