# Genie

The **Genie** section allows you to optimize your circuit design using AI agents. You can select an AI agent to perform optimization tasks based on your circuit's specifications and parameters.

---

## Optimization with AI Agents

- **Select AI Agent**: Choose from a range of AI agents available to optimize your circuit's performance. The AI agent will automatically adjust variables and parameters to improve the circuit's efficiency, stability, or performance based on predefined criteria.

---

## Available Actions

- **View Log File**: Access the detailed log of the optimization process. This log contains valuable insights into how the AI agent performed the optimization and any changes made to the circuit.
- **Download Netlist**: Download the netlist generated after the optimization process. This netlist reflects the changes made by the AI agent.
- **Import from File**: Import a previously saved Genie configuration or parameters to continue optimization or modify settings.
- **Export to File**: Save the current Genie settings and optimization results to a file for future use or sharing.

## Scalar Measurements and Expressions

You can also use the scalar measurements taken earlier in the **Design Parameters** section and combine them with symbols to create expressions for further optimization. This allows for dynamic adjustments based on real-time data and simulation results.
